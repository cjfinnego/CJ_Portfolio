Data Science Portfolio

# [Project 1: Boston House Price Prediction Web App](https://github.com/cjfinnego/boston-webapp)
* Created a tool that estimates the housing prices in Boston, MA.
* Website link shown in README.file on Github.com.

# [Project 2: Multiple Disease Prediction System](https://github.com/cjfinnego/CJ_Portfolio)
* Created a tool that classifies whether one has a disease or not.
* Scraped over 1000 job descriptions from glassdoor using python and selenium
* Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on python, excel, aws, and spark.
* Optimized Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model.
* Built a client facing API using flask

# [Bonus Project 1: Ball Image Classifier](https://github.com/cjfinnego/CJ_Portfolio)
For this example project I built a ball classifier to identify balls from different sports. This could be useful for someone who is new to sports from a certain country. They could take a picture of a ball and an app could serve them some information about the history and rules of the game. This is the underlying model for building something with those capabilities.

I was able to get the model to predict the sport of the ball with 94% accuracy after minimal tuning. For most of the cases this would meet the need of an end user of the app. To get these results I used transfer learning on a CNN trained on resnet34. This created time efficiencies and solid results.
